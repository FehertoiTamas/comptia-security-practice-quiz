    "question": "In the context of digital certificates, the term \"Root of trust\" refers to the highest level of trust within a PKI system. It is typically represented by a root CA, which is a trusted third party that serves as the foundation for the entire PKI. All other entities in the PKI hierarchy, including intermediate CAs and end-entities (such as web servers, email servers, user devices, IoT devices, and individual users), derive their trust from this root. When a certificate is issued and signed by an intermediate CA, it gains trust through a chain of trust back to the root CA. This hierarchical trust model allows users and systems to trust certificates presented by websites, services, or individuals because they can trace the trust back to the well-established root of trust.",
